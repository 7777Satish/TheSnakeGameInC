## Description

This is a classic Snake game implemented in C. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The player controls the snake's direction using the keyboard. The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## Features

## Building and Running

To build and run the game, you will need a C compiler (such as GCC) and a terminal.

1.  Clone the repository:
    bash
    gcc main.c -o snake
        > If you have multiple source files, list them all in the compilation command. You might also need to include libraries like `ncurses` depending on the implementation.  For example: `gcc main.c snake.c -o snake -lncurses`
